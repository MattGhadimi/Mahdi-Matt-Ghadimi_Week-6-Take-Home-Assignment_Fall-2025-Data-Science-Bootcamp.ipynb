- `Mahdi-Matt-Ghadimi_Week-6-Take-Home-Assignment_Fall-2025-Data-Science-Bootcamp.ipynb`  
  - Contains all solutions for 5 problems:  
    1. **Dataset Splitting** – Strategies for training, validation, and test sets including speaker-specific data.  
    2. **K-Nearest Neighbors** – 1-NN decision boundary, effect of feature scaling, handling missing features, and high-dimensional data discussion.  
    3. **Perceptron Theory** – Evaluating training vs. test error and why training error is unnecessary.  
    4. **Perceptron Weight Reconstruction** – Compute final weight vector from update log.  
    5. **Perceptron Convergence Visualization** – Implement Perceptron on 2D data and visualize decision boundary updates.
